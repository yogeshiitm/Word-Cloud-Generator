### Python script to generate a Word Cloud from an input Text File.
This is the Final Project of a Course on Python offered by Google. The goal of the project is to create a word cloud.
A word cloud is an image that's made up of different sized words.
Usually, the size of each word in the word cloud is determined by how many times it appears in the input text file.
This python script goes through an input text file (e.g. a full novel), clean up the text to remove any punctuation marks.
And then count how many times each word appears.
To keep our word cloud interesting, this script also excludes irrelevant or uninteresting words like a, the, in, on etc. while processing the text.
Finally, it makes a word cloud based on the frequency of relevant words, using an external Python module called creatively Word cloud.
